<span class="neo-latina-font" style="font-size: 64px;">KAÍVEN</span>

I've been trying to create my own Cosmosverse. I've explored a few ideas, but ultimately the motif behind them didn't feel right. Lately, I've been having visions out of nowhere. Some of them are clearly shaped by my current emotional state, but they still feel mysterious. That's where <span class="neo-latina-font">Kaíven</span> was born.

* **-ra** future
* **-sha** ongoing

#### Examples

## Naming system: people, ships, rifts

<span class="neo-latina-font">Veyruun</span> names are built like coordinates with feelings.

### People

Pattern: [core trait] + [journey marker]

* Sáliven → Hope-crosser (optimistic troublemaker)
* Drunketh → Dread-holder (the realist who still stays)
* Mórtovar → Laughter-thread (the one who keeps the story moving)

### Ships

Pattern: Vask + [epithet]

* Vask Hílen → The Homesick Ship
* Vask Nérun → Star-Bearer
* Vask Zulnai → Void-Refuser

### Rifts / portals

* Relnar-3
* Relnar Sír → The Thin Gate (sír = thin/fragile)
* Relnar Voth → The Wrong Door (voth = misaligned/uncanny)

## Dialects

<span class="neo-latina-font">Veyruun</span> has a few dialects.

### Hull Veyruun (ship crews)

* Fast, clipped, consonant-heavy.
  * zulkaíven → z'kaíven (ship slang)
* Drops unstressed vowels to save breath (and because comms cut out).
  * relnar → relnr (swallowed vowel)
* Sound changes
  * Final -n often becomes a nasal hum: ven → vẽ

#### Example

* Formal: Zan'kai venra.
* Hull: Z'kai ven'ra.

### Station (ports, traders, bureaucracy)

* Smoother, more vowels, more "polite" particles.
* Keeps distinctions because contracts, treaties, and insults require clarity.
* Sound changes
* Harsh clusters get "uncrunched"
* Tends to pronounce every marker fully.

#### Example

* relnr → relenir (extra vowel inserted)
* zan'kai venra → zana'kai venara (elongated, careful)

### Deepfold (D6+ crews, survivors, cults)

* Speech gets ritualized. People start treating words like talismans.
* Vowels lengthen, consonants soften—like speaking gently so reality doesn't notice you.
  * zul → zuul (lengthened)
  * drun → druun (dread becomes a slow tide)
* Sound changes
  * nai (not) often becomes næ (a softer refusal)

#### Example

* Zul ker nai → Zuul ker næ. (same meaning, different spine)

## Kinship terms

<span class="neo-latina-font">Veyruun</span> doesn't worship blood, it worships bond.

They have way more words for "chosen family" than for "cousin".

#### Core kin roots

* kai
* kath
* vask
* reln
* hílen
* tovar
* shur

#### Important Ones

* kathkai → oath-kin (bonded by vow, not romance necessarily)
* vaskkai → ship-kin (your crew as family; implies duty + intimacy)
* relnkai → fold-kin (bonded specifically by surviving a fold event together)
* tovarkai → story-kin (you keep each other's narrative alive, the "we don't quit" bond)
* hílenkai → home-kin (someone who feels like home even when home is gone)

#### Family roles

* kairen → bond-leader / the one who holds the group together (not "boss")
* shuren → keeper-survivor (the one who gets people through)
* relnethen → seam-guide (someone who knows folds / has crossed too much)
* vasketh → ship-keeper (mechanic/captain vibe; caretaker)

A devastating insult in this culture

* zulkathkai → false oath-kin (social execution)

## Honorifics

Two tiny particles:

* sa → respect (used with elders, captains, seam-guides)
* ri → intimacy (used with bonded kin)

#### Examples

* sa relnethen → respected seam-guide
* ri kai → my chosen (intimate)

You can combine them:

* sari (is rare and heavy) → I respect you and I'm bonded to you.
