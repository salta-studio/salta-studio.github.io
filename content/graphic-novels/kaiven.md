<span class="neo-latina-font" style="font-size: 64px;">KAÍVEN</span>

I've been trying to create my own Cosmosverse. I've explored a few ideas, but ultimately the motif behind them didn't feel right. Lately, I've been having visions out of nowhere. Some of them are clearly shaped by my current emotional state, but they still feel mysterious. That's where <span class="neo-latina-font">Kaíven</span> was born.

The cosmology of <span class="neo-latina-font">Kaíven</span> is developed through its own languages, <span class="neo-latina-font">Veyruun</span> and <span class="neo-latina-font">Ordic</span>.
