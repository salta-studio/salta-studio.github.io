I grew up in the 80s, raised by very young parents: a tech-obsessed father who believed in machines, and a mother whose soul was woven from a dozen disciplines and boundless love. 

My first computer was the legendary Commodore 64. I was only five years old, yet the moment I touched those keys, something ancient sparked inside me. The screen flickered like a doorway, and I stepped through. 

Later, I chose to study theoretical physics. Why? Because someone had to ask the impossible questions. My father urged me toward computer science but a man's got to chase his own myths, even when the world says otherwise. 

And yet, if I'm honest, I was always more artist than scientist. That part of me, the wild, expressive, aching part, was buried. I buried it. I don't blame anyone. I used to draw. I composed electronic dreams in college, mixing and sampling sounds. I joined game jams, danced with reckless abandon, inherited from my mother a love for movement. 

So what happened? Somewhere along the way, I strayed. But now, now I've returned. I've arrived. Finally. 

I built SALTA Studio, a sanctuary, a forge, a temple, where I can create without shame: stories and whatever else my heart demands. SALTA was born to rekindle the flame of my first love: storytelling. I live to craft tales that stir souls, make people weep, and provoke thought long after the final word. The name from Quechua, salta means: A place to settle down. So I did.
