I created SALTA Studio out of an (**almost desperate**) need to tell stories. Once, I heard *Alan Moore* say that storytelling is almost shamanic. That it was the shamans of the Paleolithic era who started the tradition. I found that interesting, to say the least.

I have many unwritten stories. 

I have far fewer that are written. 

I promise you, I have a brain full of useless information—and somehow I still have room for stories within stories.

Of course, none of that means they're good. 

They're great for me. 

And I can only hope someone else finds hope, or at least warm feelings, when they read them.

If you find something useful here, feel free to let me know. You can figure out how to reach me.
