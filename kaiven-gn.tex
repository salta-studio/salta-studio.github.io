\begin{GNPage}[THE MOUTH OF NIGHT]


\Panel[WIDE / EXTERIOR]{Wrecked ship against a gargantuan black hole. Accretion disk like a burning crown. Light warps.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{We have run so long that even the stars feel tired of watching us.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{The ship is ruined, its bones cracked, its skin torn, and there is no kindly harbor in the void.}

\Panel[INTERIOR / BRIDGE WIDE]{Crew slumped. Consoles flicker. ZÁALI stands, rigid, hands braced as if holding reality steady.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{They trusted me. That is the sharpest thing in the room.}

\Panel[DETAILS / SYSTEM READOUT]{Cracked screen: HULL 12\%. Failing seals.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{How many times can a man make the same choice and still call it bravery?}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{How many times can he lead others into fire and name it \textbf{the only way}?}

\lyrics{caminos largos sin un final}

\Panel[CLOSE-UP / CREW FACES]{Silent tears. Tremors. Someone’s hand hovering near an eject lever.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I wanted a simpler life once.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{A house. A door that locks. Mornings that mean bread and not battle.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{But I stepped onto this road, again, and again, and each time I told myself it was the last.}

\Panel[LOW ANGLE / ZÁALI + WINDOW]{Black hole swollen larger.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Why do I keep doing this?}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Why does it feel... like repeating?}

\Panel[FULL-BLEED / EXTERIOR]{Ship tiny, being drawn in. Stars smear.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{As if some unseen hand has set the pieces upon the board before I ever touch them.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{As if the world has grooves worn into it, and my feet find them no matter how I fight.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{If this ends the way it always ends... then what, in the name of all the lights that ever were, was I meant to learn?}

\end{GNPage}

\begin{GNPage}[A SMALL GRAVE]

\Panel[WIDE / PARK]{A modest park. Trees. A bench. Summer light. At the edge, a patch of dirt turned over.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Pain is not a stranger. It is the oldest crewman aboard every ship I have ever flown.}

\Panel[MEDIUM / YOUNG ZÁALI]{ZÁALI, 6 years old, kneeling with a small shovel. Dirt on his hands, cheeks wet. Beside him: a small bundle wrapped in cloth, his dog.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{It sits quietly in the corner while we laugh, and it does not laugh with us.}

\lyrics{sabor a silencio en cada rincón, grita el vacío de mi corazón}

\Panel[DETAIL]{His tiny fingers press earth down gently, like tucking someone in.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{It watches us eat, and sleep, and make promises we do not understand the cost of.}

\Panel[MEDIUM / THE OLD MAN ENTERS]{A mysterious old man stands a few steps away, simple clothes, unassuming, but somehow too still for the world. No sinister vibe. Just weight.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Then, when the alarms begin, it rises as if it has been waiting for its proper work.}

\Panel[TWO-SHOT / OLD MAN + CHILD]{The old man crouches to ZÁALI’s level. Gentle distance.}

\Dialogue{OLD MAN}{What was his name?}

\Panel[CLOSE-UP / YOUNG ZÁALI]{ZÁALI looks up, watery eyes, throat tight, can’t answer. His mouth opens but no sound comes.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{They tell you existence is a gift.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{If so, it is a gift wrapped in thorns, and the blood on the ribbon is usually yours.}

\Panel[MEDIUM / OLD MAN, SOFT]{The old man’s expression is calm, tender, certain in a way that’s almost frightening because it’s kind.}

\Dialogue{OLD MAN}{I understand your pain.

You will see them again... your dogs.

Just not in the way you probably expect.

You are too young to understand... but time will show you.}

\end{GNPage}

\begin{GNPage}[BACK TO THE SHIP]

\Panel[INTERIOR / BRIDGE]{A jolt. Sparks. Crew brace.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I have crossed a hundred skies. I have tasted a hundred triumphs.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{None of them were clean.}

\Panel[EXTERIOR / SHIP]{Ship tumbling slightly as gravity pulls.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Victory is only a word we use when grief has not yet caught up.}

\Panel[MONTAGE]{Overlay images like memory shards: a helmet spinning in space, a hand slipping away, a body wrapped and sent outward.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I remember faces the way sailors remember storms.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{A smile that went out.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{A hand reaching for mine... only emptiness.}

\Panel[CLOSE-UP / ZÁALI’S HANDS]{His hands tremble, then steady.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I have buried companions in places that do not allow graves.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I have left them drifting where no planet will ever claim them.}

\Panel[CLOSE-UP / CREW MEMBER]{A crew member, awake now, staring at ZÁALI as if asking without words: why again?}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{It is a strange thing, to be called \textbf{leader}, when all your path is marked by those who followed you and did not return.}

\Panel[WINDOW / BLACK HOLE]{The black hole now dominates.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Some nights I wonder if I am a collector of endings.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{And the worst of it is not that I lost them.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{The worst of it is that I can still feel them... aching where they used to be.}

\end{GNPage}


\begin{GNPage}[THE OLD MAN LEAVES]

\Panel[MEDIUM / OLD MAN STANDS]{The old man rises with effort that looks performed like he’s pretending to be old.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{There are losses you can accept: the swift, clean kind, where the universe is merely cruel.}

\Panel[DETAIL / YOUNG ZÁALI’S FACE]{Z'AALI’s grief shifts into confusion, hope intruding like an unfamiliar guest.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{And then there are the other losses... the ones that return.}

\Panel[WIDE / THE PARK PATH]{The old man begins walking away along the path. Sunlight behind him.}

\Dialogue{YOUNG ZÁALI}{...I’ll see him again?}

\Panel[OVER-SHOULDER / OLD MAN, NOT TURNING AROUND]{The old man does not look back... like looking back would break a rule.}

\Dialogue{OLD MAN}{Yes}

\Panel[SURREAL HINT / CHILD POV]{For a moment, the world feels subtly wrong: a bird freezes for a fraction, leaves hang too still, the old man’s outline \textbf{double-exposes} as if time stuttered.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{They do not return as they were.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{A familiar laugh in a stranger’s mouth.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{A gaze that once knew you, now sliding past as if you are smoke.}

\Panel[MEDIUM / YOUNG ZÁALI ALONE]{ZÁALI kneels by the small grave, staring after the old man. The park feels larger now, as if it contains an infinite distance.}

\end{GNPage}

\begin{GNPage}[THE SEARCH BEGINS]

\Panel[MONTAGE / SPACEPORT CROWD]{Adult ZÁALI in a crowd on a distant world. He spots someone with a familiar posture.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I have found them again. Sometimes years later. Sometimes worlds away.}

\Panel[MONTAGE / NEAR-MISS DOOR]{A door closes. ZÁALI arrives late.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{...and I have missed them by a single choice, a single hour, a single wrong door.}

\Panel[MONTAGE / DIFFERENT LIFE]{A person laughs, same laugh as someone we saw die earlier, but in a different face.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{Do you know what it is to search for a person across the breadth of the cosmos, armed only with grief and intuition?}

\Panel[MONTAGE / SILHOUETTE]{A silhouette in rain and neon. ZÁALI’s heart in his throat. It’s not them.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{To see a silhouette in a crowd and feel your heart lunge like a dog straining at the leash only to be disappointed, again.}

\Panel[MONTAGE / THE NAME FALLS]{ZÁALI speaks a name (balloon cropped). The stranger smiles politely. No recognition.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{To speak a name you are not sure you are allowed to speak, and watch it fall to the floor between you like a dead thing.}

\Panel[BACK TO PRESENT / BRIDGE]{Adult ZÁALI on the bridge again, eyes hollowed by years.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{They do not remember dying for me.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{And I... I remember too much.}

\lyrics{en la sombra se esconden verdades... te busco en el aire en mil paisajes}

\end{GNPage}

\begin{GNPage}[THE ARCHITECT]

\Panel[SHIP SHUDDERS]{Reality leans.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{What breaks him is the pattern.}

\Panel[VISUAL PATTERN MONTAGE]{Repeated imagery across time: the same reaching hand, the same farewell, the same red warning light, like the cosmos has a template.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{The sense that suffering is not an accident, but a design.}

\Panel[BLACK HOLE AS EYE]{Frame the hole like an eye. Let the lensing look like a face for a heartbeat.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{I have stared into the dark long enough to suspect it stares back.}

\Panel[THE “SEAM”]{A nav-map glitches into impossible geometry. A faint grid behind the stars only for a moment.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{There are days I feel the seams of the world beneath my fingertips.}

\Panel[ZÁALI’S DECISION]{He stands straighter. Crew sense it.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{And I know... that there will be another battle after this one.}

\Panel[HINT OF A GREATER WAR]{A symbolic panel: nine distant points of light arranged not like stars but like chosen placement. Or nine “shadows” implied in the lensing.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{against the hands that set the rules of the game and call it existence.}

\lyrics{dime ¿dónde va lo que no se dice? ¿se pierde, se queda o cicatriza?}

\end{GNPage}

\begin{GNPage}[THE VOW]

\Panel[CREW QUIET]{A hand on a shoulder. Exhaustion as intimacy.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{If I were wise, I would let the dark take us gently.}

\Panel[TEMPTATION OF REST]{Peaceful composition poisoned by the black hole’s edge.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{But I cannot.}

\Panel[FLASHBACK MICRO-BEAT]{Tiny insert panel: young ZÁALI’s wet eyes. The old man’s voice echoes.}

\Dialogue{OLD MAN}{You will see them again...}

\Panel[ZÁALI RISES]{He becomes something sharper.}

\Caption{ZÁALI}{And if suffering is the law, then I will become its heresy.}

\Panel[FULL-BLEED / DOOR IN THE DARK]{In the blackness: a hairline seam, like a doorframe made of nothing.}

\Caption{

\center \textit{Lo var delna.}

\textit{Lo var na kaelle nor.}

\textit{Eth etheth silna varën, na eth kuul.}

\textit{Ja na tal kaelna...}
